HousePoint Project Proposal
Introduction
HousePoint is a mobile application designed to help families manage household chores while making the process fun and rewarding for children. Parents often face challenges in organizing and tracking chores, while kids may lack the motivation to complete them. HousePoint solves this problem by providing a simple and engaging platform where parents can assign chores, kids can track their progress, and both can enjoy a structured reward system.
The app is especially valuable for families with young children or seniors who want a straightforward way to stay engaged in household responsibilities. By combining gamification with easy-to-use tracking, HousePoint encourages responsibility, teamwork, and accountability within the household.
Built with Xcode and SwiftUI, and managed through GitHub, the project will allow the development team to practice real-world mobile app development workflows while creating a product that solves an everyday problem.
